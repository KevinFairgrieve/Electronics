== Projects

The following chapters describe some of my active projects. The majority of my former projects (see <<Old.adoc#, Old>> (in german)) are
in a frozen state now. This is due to the fact that I completely shifted the µCs from the AVR-family (DA, DB, tiny1/2) to the more powerful 
STM32-family, mainly the STM32G4xx. These have enough computing resources for the <<sdr>> project, which would have been impossible sticking to 
the AVRs. 

Well, there is one exception: the <<corona>>.

[[corona]]
=== Corona RP8D1 replacement firmware

The `Corona RP8D1` receiver come into several flavors, for the 35MHz band, the 40MHz and the 72MHz band (afaik). 
The reason for giving a substantial amount of time to develop a new firmware for this receiver is the fact that I am
_hoarding_ vintage electronic RC stuff. Unfortunately some of this gear wasn't working anymore. In the process of 
reworking these things I needed a good receiver and I decided to get a scan-receiver without external crystals. But it turns out
that the mostly helpful signal filtering of the `Corona` receiver makes the situation worse if one tries to use these multi-channels
extensions in the transmitters. These encoders produce a time-multiplex over one RC channel, and the correspondant decoder
isn't capable decoding the time multiplex if the receiver modifies / filters the impulse durations. So, the project started ;-) 

There is an extra repositoty https://github.com/wimalopaan/CoronaRP8D1[] for this project.

[[sdr]]
=== SDR RC receiver for 27/35/40MHz

My most ambitious project. The origin is also in <<corona>>. The goal is to design a SDR as a I/Q-mixer (tayloe-mixer) with zero-IF and a STM32G431 doing all
the DSP stuff.

Actually, this works for ppm/pcm-modulation in the near field of the transmitter. 

Remaining problems are sensitivity and AGC.

There is no documentation yet.

=== Touch-Screen for the FrSky X12S

In my opinion the `FrSky X12S` is a very well designed and high-quality RC transmitter. Together with https://edgetx.org[EdgeTx] this is unbeatable.
The only drawback is, that it has no touch-screen. I managed to modify https://edgetx.org[EdgeTx] and the hardware to get the same touch-LCD as with the 
RadioMaster TX16S working inside the X12s.

The software modifications are in mainline https://edgetx.org[EdgeTx] (no need to patch or modify) and the hardware modification is described in an extra 
document: {ddir}/rc/touch.html[X12S touch]

=== Modification of an old Graupner / JR 40MHz transmitter RF modul for use in e.g. a Radiomaster TX16s / FrSky X12S/X9e or similar

Modern handsets with a JR-like module bay provide a `cppm`-signal and battery-voltage on the pins of the connector. 
Therefore it must be possible to use an old vintage _Graupner JR 40MHz_ quarz transmitter module together with an old 40MHz quarz receiver.

The good news are: yes, it is possible. *But* ...

[CAUTION]
--
It is tempting to place an old 40MHz JR module into the module bay of a modern handset. 

Please: *don't do this!!!*

You can damage your handset!

[[elrs_jr]]
=== JR-module-bay adapter for ELRS receiver as transmitter

==== Using ELRS receivers as transmitter-modules

Since the differences between ELRS receivers and transmitters (well: both are transceivers and the differences are mostly in transmit-power) are
marginal, one can use every ELRS receiver as a transmitter. Of course, you have to flash a different firmware to it.
See <<elrs_esp8285>> and <<elrs_esp32>> for the correct setting in `expresslrs-configurator`.

[CAUTION]
--
Don't expect the range to be more than 1km. Please test before going to the field (or lake)!

==== JR-Module-bay adapter

The communication between the handset and the tranceiver-module inside the JR-module bay takes place over 
`CRSF` / half-duplex serial protocol. The main difficulty here is that for historic reasons the polarity of the 
physical layer is inverted, so the idle level is low (0V) instead of high (3.3V) as normal. The `ESP8285` based boards
aren't capable of processing inverted serial signals. 

The next culprit is that there is no 5V regulated voltage on the pins of the module bay, but the ELRS receiver boad needs
5V regulated voltage.

Due to this fact it would be most convenient to have a adapter, that

* produces the regulated 5V out of the main battery voltage of the handset,
* uninvertes the inverted serial data, and
* splits the half-duplex connection into a seperated full-duplex one.

If you are interested in the pinout of the module bay, see: https://www.expresslrs.org/quick-start/transmitters/tx-prep[pinout]

[[elrs_x12s]]
=== Adapter for ELRS receiver as internal XJT/ISRM module for FrSky X12S

If you don't want to use an external ELRS transceiver module e.g. for the JR-bay of your handset, then you may choose to replace the 
internal XJT / ISRM module of the X12S with an ELRS module. 

As mentioned in <<elrs_jr>> it is possible to use (most) ELRS receivers as trasmitters (well: transceiver). The advantage of this approach
is that the ELRS is so tiny, that you can mount it onto the X12S internal daughter boad. Maybe you can also use the antennas of the X12S if
the ELRS is also working at 2.4 GHz. The disadvantage is clearly, that the range is somewhat limited: don't expect it to be more than 1km and 
please make range tests before going to the field or lake.

You can hand-wire all the stuff but much more convenient is a small adapter board as is <<x12s_elrs_sch>> and <<x12s_elrs_pcb>>.

If you use _Target 3001_ as your EDA: link:elrs/x12s/X12S_ELRS_Adapter.T3001[Target 3001 design file].

=== The `CruiseController` 

The `CC` (CruiseController) is like a _Flight-Controller_ but mainly for ship/boat-models.

It consists of 

* ELRS receiver
* Bluetooth module
* Servo-PWM-outputs
* SBus(2)/IBus/SumdV3 output
* SBus(2)/S.Port/IBus/Hott telemetry
* 4 direct switching lines (up to 1A@16V) (shared with servo pwm outputs)
* additional serial connections (e.g. GPS)
* V/ESC support
* 16-channel switching mezzanine board
* 16-channel LED mezzanine board

_OpenTx weekly_ is a https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCedl1hS-dfWh-V4WBz_jGog[YouTube]-channel mostly 
for EdgeTx and OpenTx stuff but also for my above electronic projects. Unfortunately the spoken language is german :-(
